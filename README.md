## 🍦 What is Honest Foodie?




Honest Foodie is a web-based app that **fights bad recipes** 
that can be found in the online space. Instead on this platform
users can review recipes from other social media platforms and 
find what recipes not only look good but taste good as well.

## 🏸 Optimizations

- Able to search for recipes optimally - ideally implement Elasticsearch
- Create a better algorithm for detecting what is trending, popular

## 🔍 Discoveries

The Honest Foodie website is still under development, and we're working on a lot of things at the moment. I learned that to populate trending posts, it is pretty complicated. I am learning about the concept of trending and working towards creating an effective algorithm.
